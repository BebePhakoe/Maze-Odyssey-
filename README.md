My first ever application project called #MAZE ODYSSEY

My idea for my first ever project application was a 
Maze. My inspiration was me remembering how much I
was used to enjoy playing snake on my mothers phone
or going to the arcade to go play pac-man.

I decided to do project individually.

I made use of UNITY ENGIN and VS CODE, they
were my true help during this project.
